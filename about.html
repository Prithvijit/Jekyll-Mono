  	<p class="about-text"> As of Fall 2016, I am working as a Research Assistant in the Computer Vision Machine Learning and Perception Lab (CVMLP) at Virginia Tech. I am advised by <a href="https://filebox.ece.vt.edu/~parikh/">Dr. Devi Parikh</a> and <a href="https://filebox.ece.vt.edu/~dbatra/">Dr. Dhruv Batra</a> (currently visiting researchers at FAIR). The problems that I work on lie at the intersection of Computer Vision, Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. My research interests focus on Semantic Scene Understanding and Artificial Intelligence. I am also interested in the interpretability aspect of Deep Learning models. </p>

	  <p class="about-text">Previously, I have worked with <a href="http://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~mkrishna/">Dr. K. Madhava Krishna</a> on problems relating to Robot Vision and Navigation at Robotics Research Lab, IIIT Hyderabad. My interest in robotics stemmed from being a part of Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Team in my undergrad days. I specifically worked on Underwater Acoustics and Control System problems relating to the bot.</p>

	  <p class="about-text">I also find Theoretical Physics to be fascinating. Iâ€™ve had the privilege to work with <a href="http://mailweb.iacs.res.in/theoph/tpssg/">Dr. Soumitra Sengupta</a> on f(R) gravity. Our quasi-static journey towards a unified theory, joining Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity, is a rewarding one. My interest in this specific branch of physics originated from trying to study and understand Differential Geometry in my early undergrad days.</p> 

	  <p class="about-text">I occasionally play the percussion instrument Tabla. I am very passionate about movies. I love to break them down shot-by-shot and analyze them. Every single frame is important.</p>
